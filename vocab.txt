Derivation Indicator: A derivation indicator is an indicator of which derivation rules were used in deriving a 
particular string or substring. The derivation indicator does not include the derivation indicators of children. The 
derivation indicator is expressed in a series of subscripts [], where each subscript represents which 
derivation rule was applied at a given level of the expression.

Location Indicator: A location indicator indicates a rule and location within the rule's expression. Location 
Indicators are most commonly used determine which derivations could possibly apply to the substring of the source file 
at the processing cursor's current position. Location indicators do not include the location indicators of children. 
Location indicators are expressed in a series of subscripts [], where each subscript represents the sub-expression in 
which the location is found.
