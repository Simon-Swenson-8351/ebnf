1.  Open the .ebnf file and copy it to a memory buffer.
2.  Parse the ebnf memory buffer using the ebnf library. The output is an ebnf object.
3.  Branch based off of what the user wants to do with the EBNF:
    1.  Create the source code for a parser:
    2.  Use the EBNF to parse a source file in process:
3.  Open the source code file and copy it to a memory buffer.
4.  Parse the source code memory buffer using the ebnf object and the ebnf library. The output is a parse tree.
5.  Use or save the parse tree as desired.
